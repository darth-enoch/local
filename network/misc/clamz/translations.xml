        <Description xml:lang="tr">Clamz is a little command-line program to download MP3 files from
Amazon.com's music store.  It is intended to serve as a substitute
for Amazon's official MP3 Downloader, which is not free software (and
therefore is only available in binary form for a limited set of
platforms.)  Clamz can be used to download either individual songs or
complete albums that you have purchased from Amazon.</Description>
