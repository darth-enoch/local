# This file should contain one line per IP-address,

# and must not contain empty lines. If the file does not exist, everyone
# is allowed to connect. If the file exists but is empty, nobody is allowed
# to connect. Otherwise, nbd-server will only allow clients to connect whose
# IP-adres is listed in this file.
